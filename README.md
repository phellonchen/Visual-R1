# Visual R1: Transfer Reasoning Ability from R1 to Visual R1

DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates outstanding reasoning abilities across various problems except visual-related problems. Although there are some efforts to implement multimodal R1, they all focus on enhancing the reasoning ability of VL models. 

We build this project to create a model that can transfer reasoning Ability from LLMs (R1) to MLLMs (Visual R1).
